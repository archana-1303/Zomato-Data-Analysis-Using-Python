README - Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis

This project is about analyzing the Zomato  Restaurant Dataset.
I used Python and data visualization libraries to understand how customers rate restaurants, how much they vote, and how cost, online orders, and restaurant types are related.

What’s in this project?
In this project, I have done:

- Data Loading – Loaded the Zomato dataset using pandas.
- Data Cleaning – Removed unwanted characters, handled missing values, converted cost and rating columns to proper numeric format.
- Data Analysis – Analyzed:

Restaurant types

Online order availability

Votes received

Cost for two people

Ratings

- Data Visualization – Plotted the following graphs:

Countplot of restaurant types

Votes distribution by restaurant type

Ratings histogram

Cost distribution

Boxplot to compare ratings based on online order availability

Heatmap to show relation between restaurant type & online orders

- Found Insights like:

Which restaurants get the highest votes

How ratings are distributed

Whether online order affects ratings

Which restaurant types mostly offer online order


- Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to practice Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and understand how various factors like cost,
online orders, votes, and restaurant types affect ratings and customer behavior.
